# Stock Data Downloader

This Python project consists of two main components: `TickersDownloader` and `QuotesDownloader`, each serving different purposes. The project uses various libraries such as `pandas`, `yfinance`, and `requests` for data manipulation, downloading, and API requests. Below are the main functionalities and structures of each component:

## Tickers Downloader (`tickers_downloader.py`)

### Purpose:
- Downloads and updates the list of tickers traded on NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX exchanges using the NASDAQ Stock Screener and Yahoo API.
- Downloads history of quotes into files with the ticker symbol as the filename in the data folder.

### Key Files:
- `tickers_downloader.py`: Contains the `TickersDownloader` class responsible for downloading and updating tickers.

### Features:
- Configuration loaded from a YAML file (`config/tickers_downloader.yaml`).
- Custom class for loading configurations (`utils.load_config.LoadConfig`).
- Use of a custom session with rate limiting for API requests (`utils.cached_limiter_session.CachedLimiterSession`).

### Main Steps:
1. **Download Tickers:** Fetches the full list of shares from the NASDAQ Stock Screener API.
2. **Preprocess Data:** Filters, cleans, and updates the columns of the downloaded tickers data.
3. **Add New Data to File:** Appends new data to an existing CSV file, avoiding duplicates.
4. **Update Tickers Data:** Utilizes Yahoo Finance API to update additional data for tickers.

## Quotes Downloader (`quotes_downloader.py`)

### Purpose:
- Downloads and updates historical quotes for each ticker.
- Saves quotes into individual CSV files for each ticker in a specified directory.

### Key Files:
- `quotes_downloader.py`: Contains the `QuotesDownloader` class responsible for downloading and updating quotes.

### Features:
- Configuration loaded from a YAML file (`config/quotes_downloader.yaml`).
- Usage of tickers data for filtering (`config/tickers_downloader.yaml`).
- Custom session with rate limiting for Yahoo Finance API requests.
- Filtering and cleaning historical quotes.

### Main Steps:
1. **Update Quotes:** Continuously downloads and updates historical quotes for tickers based on specified conditions.
2. **Filter and Save Quotes:** Filters and saves historical quotes based on specific conditions, such as minimum average trade value.
